## What is COBOL?
COBOL stands for common business-oriented language. It's a language made with an english-like syntax used mainly by businesses. COBOL is rarely used now days.

This is powered by [GnuCOBOL](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnucobol/)(formerly known as OpenCOBOL), a compiler for COBOL that is [free and libre](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html).

## FizzBuzz Challenge in COBOL
The FizzBuzz challenge is a simple programming task often used in software development interviews to assess a candidate's ability to work with numbers and conditionals. The task is to print numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".
